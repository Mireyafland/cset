1.How I feel about the pace of the program is a bit to fast for me. Everything we have been learn I have a brief idea but just need more practice with it. For example the global and local scopes. When reading it in the book it was kind of confusing understanding the two differences between the two. But when explained with an example i got more of an understanding of global and local scopes.

2.Function are useful tool to organize large programs because it names what each line of program is doing. If you just have one big large of program and no organizations and then an error happens it will be really hard to find the error since no functions was there to help you out.

With the zookeeper analogy that was explained between global and local scopes. the analogy was there is a zoo keeper

let the zookeeper = "Bob'
let function = lion(leo)
console.log(lion)
reutrn (leo)
that is a local scope
and there was a lion called leo. Both leo and both are local scopes. A global scope is something that was not defined within the function that you can mess with.
