After completing this course i give myself a rate of 5. I give myself this rate because there is so much to know and jammed in. More practice with the problems with the tutoring is what I have should done differently in the beginning. I will for now on just go to the tutoring people because they do a amazing job helping and doing the steps with you together.

The Weresquirrel program showed many uses for JavaScript Objects and Arrays. Using variables and values from this example, explain the difference between the two data structures.
  The weresquirrel program example using objects is they used the square brackets to put the array of object they defined when trying to find out when jacques was turning to a squirrel. let day1 = {
  squirrel: false,
  events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"] 
};
to log what he was doing at that day with different events. 

The author chose to use one structure over the example because it had a good definiton and example explaining arrays and objects. How arrays and object help with my game is bu organzing each room with the two door option am I choosing from. And since arrays are more than one and you do choose one door but there are two options.
