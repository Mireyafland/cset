After two weeks of this program what I am having trouble with so far is when writting out the solution in english and trying to translate them into the step by step coding. I get more confused with it because of not enough excerise and practices. How this will change is by reading more resources, using codecademy. Also tutoring during the tutoring hours and asking as much questions when I do not understand. 

The difference between the three style of loops which are for loops, while loops and do-while. For loop are initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, more efficient to debug structure of looping. And also Statement will be executed once the condition is checked. With the statement be excuted it can be zero times. do-While loop is the opposite of a for loop the statement is excuted at least once. Also do-while loops are exit controlled loop. while loops will loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 

It is important to learn to write your solution in english because it helps you out how to write your code step by step. For example if you try to just code the solution and there is an error. It will be harder to find the error because you do not have the step by step written in paper before writing it in code.
