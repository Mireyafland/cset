We learned Web Development because it is a standard way to create user interfaces across platforms, but then we learned all of the non-standard aspects that we have to look out for. What does that tell you about building other platform specific user interfaces?

What it tells me about building other platforms is that it is every easy to make mistakes and you have to make sure it is not confusing for the people when looking at the sit and trying to use it. Also make the design consistent and do not change it unless you have too. For example if you go on an xfinity account homepage the navgation bar is style one way but as you click on other pages the navgation bar style changes, which can be confusing for the people using it.

Two examples that uses CSS Media Queries are @media code you can change the width and height of the media to make it fit on the computer screen or make it a bit smaller.and another one is thr screen resolution. What screen resolution does is check the pixel the media you are using as so it can adjust correctly in the computer screen. The way how the media ruleset will be correct or not is if you do a check and if it turn out true the ruleset works. But if not and the test result comes out Not then you can not use the feature as a ruleset.

Do you think it is better to define Breakpoints using standard device sizes or using the specific content on your site? Why?

I think it depends on the content you are using on the website to see what kind of breaking points to use or if they need any breaking points. And a good way to check and see is to look at different browser of the file you are using and see if there are any differences and if the differences are good or bad. What changes do you have to make.
