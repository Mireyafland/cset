Why do you think it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company?		
		
		I think it is important that HTML is a standard controlled by specification rather than being owned by one person is because if it is controlled by one person than that indiviual will update however they want. And also HTMl would not be what it is today.
		Describe the difference between an element and a tag. Use examples.
		
		An element in HTML is represents the root of the document you are in and the tag are the symbols we used within a website to define and format it the way we want to format it.
		
		In the lecture, I used two quotes from Yoda and Noam Chomsky to explain syntax and semantics. Explain these quotes and how they relate to the HTML you write.
		
		The yoda quote was basically saying failure it the best teacher because we learn from what we do wrong and the failures we made. And how we can do better next time. The Noam Chomsky quote I did not understand much of what it was saying but it is still a pretty cool quote.
