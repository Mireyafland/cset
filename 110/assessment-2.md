Pick your favorite CSS property so far. Explain what it's used for and all the potential values or units it can take. Why do you like it?

My favorite CSS property so far probably has to be font-family, color and background color. What we used the font-family for is what the website going to look like. Is it going to be times new roman or do you wanna make it more fannier with lobster and so many more. The font the website is on plays a big role on if your website going to be appealing to the eyes or not. Same thing that goes for color of the font and the background. I am big on colors not being to much for the eyes but pleasing to it instead.

Imagine you are making a website for a restaurant and you need to style the menu options to show that some are spicy or vegetarian or gluten-free. If all the menu options are using the same HTML elements, what CSS selector(s) could you use and why? Show an example.

Which CSS selector I would used for the webiste for the restaurant is color scheme that would make the website appealing to the eye but also make the customer hungry. Heading font-style and family that are being used to make it easy to read. Oragnize the food with the vegeterian, gluten free to the spicy food.

Style rules sometimes conflict with each other, especially in large projects. Explain the difference between cascade, inheritance, and specificity and how you can use these concepts to organize your CSS.

The difference between cascade, inheritance and specificity are that inheritance is when there is no value that is specified to a property of an element than it takes control of it. Specificity is what CSS property value is being used the most in that element of the browser you are using. and cascade is the language tha you used to style the website you are using. cascade helps organize what each section of the website looks like to the what text you are using.
