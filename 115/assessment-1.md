Now that you've spent a few weeks working on longer projects, how do you think you'll adapt to working in the professional world?
With the projects that was longer I feel like in the work field it will be stressful but it is not gonna be a bad stress. It makes me wanna keep trying and find a solution on how to make the project better and what can I do different. It is always something to learn with each work we do.

Imagine you are building your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure project in JavaScript for the browser. The user has clicked a button to select which room to enter, walk through how you would manipulate the page to show the next room's description. Explain the DOM methods you would use and why.
How I would Manipulate the room as the character walk into the room is descrbing there is a long dark hallway and at the end of the hallway you see a light. But as walking down the hall there will be booby traps as the person walk. The DOM methods I would use is one of them is the addEventListener() the reason I would use that tag so the character can listen to the steps they are walking since there are booby traps down the hallway. document.createElement i woudl create an element so I can design that room in a way and it would be eaier to have an tag when designing it. 

Why are different data structures useful? Use the Document Object Model as an example. Would it work as any structure other than a tree?

Different data structures are useful because it makes it easier to oragnize the coding you are doing and when mistakes are made or something doesnt look right you can go back and figure out what section doesn't look right. Instead of having one big blob of code and you get stress out wondering where is the mistake at.
The Document Object Model could work as any other structure than an tree it can be a forest or anything that can be implemented in any way that is convenient for the person to understand.
